# Project sketch

This project is digital processing ECG signal and classification of the siginal with machine learning algorithms. This is part of the cource "Effective C/C++ programming" at HÃ¸gskolen i Oslo og Akershus. It will be written exclusively in C++ with Qt framework. 

Qt GUI will be the skeleton of the program. Sensor for this program will be 3 lead ECG made as result of "Medical instrumentation". ECG signal will go through basic 2.order bandpass filter, then octo-coupler and will be sampled by computer thorugh 3.5mm audio jack. Qt interface will show oscilloscope like signal view and other measured parameters ( Bpm, etc ) and result of classification.

## current plan

1. Find out if this project is do-able within given time.
2. ECG sampling feeding into data array in Qt
3. Qt GUI design
4. Digital signal processing - filtering, looking for suitable library, design pipeline for realtime processing
5. ECG dataset aquisition 
6. looking for suitable ML algorithm and library -> might want to test with python/scikit-learn
